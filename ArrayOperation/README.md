# Array Operations

This Java project provides functionalities to perform operations on 1D arrays such as finding the sum, average, highest, and lowest numbers.

## Features

- Calculate the total sum of numbers in an array
- Calculate the average of numbers in an array
- Find the highest number in an array
- Find the lowest number in an array

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system (java --version)
2. Clone this repository to your local machine
3. Compile the Java files:
    - Compile `RandomOperation.java` (javac RandomOperation.java)
    - Compile `RandomResult.java` (javac RandomResult.java)
4. Run the `RandomResult` class to see the results:
    - Execute the `RandomResult` class (java RandomResult)

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide input data or use the provided `DATA.txt` file

## File Structure

- `RandomOperation.java`: Contains the implementation of array operation methods
- `RandomResult.java`: Contains the main method to demonstrate the usage of the `RandomOperation` class
- `DATA.txt`: Sample input file containing data for array operations
